      %p After many years proving myself as a computer technician, working locally as freelance and employee, I decided to find a deeper and wider scope on computer sciences. Before I could even say guacamole I finished my studies on Network Ingeniering and started dedicating myself on making web pages. To find a good job at first was hard because of my carreer focus on CISCO systems (very helpful after a while), but with some effort, taking chances and support from my beloved ones I found a place to be, it is Web Development. Without a warning I got inlove with Ruby on Rails and started my path through it. 
      
      %p Every day learning and improving my skills is a never ending goal, but one that gives me joy, the love for new things to see, riddles, problem solving and the unstopable challenge of life itself, this is the carrer I wanted.
