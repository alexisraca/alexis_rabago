      %h2 Hello My Name Is Alexis
      %p Web developer, network engineer, video games enthusiast, cycling amateur and much more. Learning and working on web development wasn't my first idea of a dream job at first, many years of proving myself as a computer technician, working locally as freelance and employee wasn't enough. One day I decided to find a deeper and wider scope on computer sciences and before I could even say guacamole, my studies on network engineering career finished first was hard because of my career focus on CISCO systems (very helpful after a while), but with some effort, taking chances and support from my beloved ones I found a place to be, it is Web Development. Without a warning, I got in love with Ruby on Rails and started my path through it.

      %p Every day learning and improving my skills is a never ending goal, but one that gives me joy, the love for new things to see, riddles, problem-solving and the unstoppable challenge of life itself, this is the career I wanted.
